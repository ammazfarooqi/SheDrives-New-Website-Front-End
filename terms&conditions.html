              Options for Riders Our Operating Model the Platform connects independent providers of transport, courier
              services Drivers with users seeking those services Passengers. Passengers propose a price for a ride or
              service, which Drivers can accept or counter with a different offer. Passengers can choose from Drivers
              interested in their request. Once a Passenger confirms a ride, a separate agreement is established between
              the Passenger and the Driver. Passengers pay Drivers the mutually agreed price directly, covering all
              costs (e.g., tolls, taxes, and fees).

              SDrives is the platform that connects Couriers with Users (Senders). When a Sender wants to make a
              delivery, they propose a price for the Courier’s service. The Courier has the choice to accept that price
              or suggest something different.
            </p>
            <p>The Sender will then pay the agreed-upon amount through the platform, which covers all costs involved in
              the delivery like fees, taxes, tolls, and any other charges. SDrives doesn’t get involved in the payment
              between the Sender and the Courier; that’s all handled directly between them. Users Responsibilities</p>

            <p>Make sure the courier can easily access the delivery address, and either you or someone you trust should
              be available to accept the parcel when it arrives. It’s on you to pack the parcel securely so nothing gets
              damaged during transit. If anything’s delayed or damaged due to poor packing or wrong delivery details,

              As a Courier, you are responsible for ensuring the Parcel is safely and promptly transported from

            <p>Upon receiving the Parcel from the Sender, you may choose to Carefully inspect its contents. Ask the
              Sender to disclose the contents and properly seal the package. Refuse to accept the Parcel if the Sender
              refuses to comply, or if the contents seem suspicious or illegal. If you suspect a breach of these Terms

              confirm, the deal made directly between both of you.</p>
            <p>Payment: The Passenger pays the agreed price directly to the Driver through the platform. This price
              covers everything tolls, taxes, and any extra fees. SDrives doesn't get involved in payments. It’s all
              between you and the Driver.

              Creating Ride Offers: Drivers can post their ride offers, with details like pick up time, location, number
              of seats, and the price. Agreeing to Offers: The Passenger can agree to the Driver’s offer and price. The
              Driver can accept or decline the request.</p>
